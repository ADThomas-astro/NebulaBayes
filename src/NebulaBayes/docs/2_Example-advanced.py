This script shows examples of more advanced usage of NebulaBayes.

There are examples of how to:
 - Filter a model grid table to consider a smaller parameter space than the
   full grid
 - Include upper bounds
 - Include a custom prior
 - Use a custom plotting callback to add annotations to plots
 - Use the built-in dereddening capability
 - Retrieve information on the parameter estimates and comparison of the
   "best model" from output tables using the NebulaBayes API.

This script may be run unchanged to save output in the NebulaBayes/docs
directory.  Otherwise add a custom "OUT_DIR" below.

    Example callback function passed to NebulaBayes to calculate a custom prior.

    Calculate a prior PDF over the n-D interpolated grid, combining a
    contribution from a line-ratio prior with a contribution from information
    on a particular grid parameter (the ionisation parameter).

    This function shows the required inputs and output.

    Arguments for the observed data:
        DF_obs:     A pandas DataFrame table holding the observed fluxes, with
                    a row for each line.
        obs_flux_arr_dict: A dictionary mapping line names to n-D arrays of
                    observed fluxes over the entire grid.  The fluxes will be
                    the same everywhere unless deredden=True, in which case the
                    fluxes were dereddened to match the predicted Balmer
                    decrement at each point in the interpolated parameter space.
                    The fluxes have been normalised to the input norm_line.
        obs_err_arr_dict:  Same as obs_flux_arr_dict, but for the flux errors.
    Arguments for the model data:
        grids_dict: Dictionary that maps line names to n-D interpolated flux
                    arrays.  These interpolated arrays are based on the input
                    grid and have been normalised to the input norm_line.
        grid_spec:  A NB1_Process_grids.Grid_description instance holding basic
                    information for the interpolated grids, such as the
                    parameter names, parameter values and the grid shape.
        grid_rel_err: The systematic relative error on grid fluxes, as a linear
                    proportion between 0 and 1.  This is an input into
                    NebulaBayes.
