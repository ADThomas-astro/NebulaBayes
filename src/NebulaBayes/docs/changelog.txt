v0.9.3  November 2017:  Some optimisations, without any behaviour changes.
        Calculating the likelihood is now significantly faster for large
        interpolated grids and where flux upper bounds aren't used.  This was
        achieved by avoiding using intermediate arrays in the calculations.
        Marginalising PDFs is now faster for grids with 4 or more dimensiions
        due to the use of a cache.
v0.9.4  January 2018:  Allowed the use of linear or cubic interpolation when
        interpolating input model grid flux arrays, with the new added keyword
        option "interp_order".  Previously only linear interpolation was
        available.
v0.9.5  January 2018:  Convert print statements to use python logging, and add
        the "verbosity" argument to NB_Model.__call__.  Some minor changes to
        better support unicode in python 2.
