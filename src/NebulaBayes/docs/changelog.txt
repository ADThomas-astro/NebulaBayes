v0.9.3  November 2017:  Some optimisations, without any behaviour changes.
        Calculating the likelihood is now significantly faster for large
        interpolated grids and where upper bounds aren't used.  This was
        achieved by avoiding using intermediate arrays in the calculations.
        Marginalising PDFs is now faster for grids with 4 or more dimensiions
        due to the use of a cache.
