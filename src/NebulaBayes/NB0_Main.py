    def __init__(self, grid_table, grid_params=None, line_list=None, **kwargs):
        """
        Initialise an instance of the NB_Model class.  Load the model fluxes
        and interpolate them to a higher-density grid, ready to calculate
        likelihoods when this NB_Model instance is called with observed fluxes.

        Basic parameters
        ----------
        grid_table : "HII", "NLR", str filename, or a pandas DataFrame
            The table of photoionisation model grid fluxes.  Allowed inputs are
            the strings "HII" or "NLR" to use one of the NebulaBayes built-in
            grids, a filename for a csv, FITS (.fits) or compressed FITS
            (fits.gz) file, or a pre-loaded pandas DataFrame instance.
            Each gridpoint (point in parameter space) is a row in the table.
            There is a column for each parameter; the location of a gridpoint
            is defined by these parameter values.  There is a column of fluxes
            for each modelled emission line.
            No assumptions are made about the order of the gridpoints (rows) or
            the order of the columns in the table.  Unnecessary columns will be
            ignored, but the number of rows must be exact - the grid must be
            rectangular with exactly one gridpoint for every possible
            combination of included parameter values.  Note that the sampling
            of a parameter (spacing of gridpoints) may be uneven.
            Model fluxes will be normalised by NebulaBayes (see "norm_line"
            parameter to __call__ below).  Any non-finite fluxes (e.g. NaNs)
            will be set to zero.
        grid_params : list of strings or None, optional
            The names of the grid parameters, which must be specified if a grid
            other than the "HII" or "NLR" built-in grids is used.  Each name
            must match a column header in the grid_table.  Default lists are
            ["log U", "log P/k", "12 + log O/H"] for grid_table == "HII", and
            ["log U", "log P/k", "12 + log O/H", "log E_peak"] for
            grid_table == "NLR".  Permute the list to change the order of the
            grid dimensions, i.e. the order of array indexing in NebulaBayes
            and the order of parameters in the output plots.
        line_list : list of strings or None, optional
            The emission lines to use in this NB_Model instance.  Each name
            must match a column name in grid_table.  Exclude lines which won't
            be used in parameter estimation to save time and memory.  By
            default all non-parameter table columns are included.

        Optional parameters
        -------------------
        interpd_grid_shape : list of integers, optional
            The size of each dimension of the interpolated flux grids - larger
            numbers give a higher density uniform sampling of the fluxes.  The
            order of the integers corresponds to the order of parameters in
            grid_params.  The default is to have an equal number of points
            along each dimension such that there are ~60000 points in total in
            an interpolated grid.  The interpd_grid_shape has a major impact on
            the speed of the grid interpolation and on memory usage.
        interp_order : integer, optional
            The order of the polynomials used for interpolating model fluxes,
            either 1 (linear) or 3 (cubic; an experimental option).  Default: 1
        grid_error : float between 0 and 1, optional
            The systematic relative error on grid fluxes, as a linear
            proportion.  Default is 0.35 (average of errors 0.15 dex above and
            0.15 dex below).

            "grids" attribute.  A flux array can be accessed with e.g.
            Interpd_grids.grids["No_norm"]["OIII5007"] (for the un-normalised
            grids).  Other attributes include "param_names",
            "param_values_arrs" and "shape", which are in the order
            corresponding to the indexing of the flux arrays, "ndim" and
            "n_gridpoints".
        Raw_grids : NB1_Process_grids.NB_Grid instance
            As for Interpd_grids, but holds the flux arrays corresponding to

        Run NebulaBayes Bayesian parameter estimation using the interpolated
        grids stored in this NB_Model object.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        obs_fluxes : list of floats
            The observed emission-line fluxes.  Use a flux of minus infinity
            (-np.inf) for a measurement that is an upper limit.  Fluxes and
            errors must already be dereddened, unless "deredden" below is True.
        obs_flux_errors : list of floats
            The corresponding measurement errors
        obs_line_names : list of str
            The corresponding emission line names, matching names in the header
            of the input grid flux table
        
        Optional parameters - for parameter estimation
        ----------------------------------------------
        norm_line : str
            Observed and grid fluxes will be normalised to this emission line.
            Because the likelihood calculation will use fluxes that are
            actually ratios to this line, the choice may affect parameter
            estimation.  Where the interpolated model grid for norm_line has
            value zero, the normalised grids are set to zero.  Default: "Hbeta"
        likelihood_lines : list of str
            A subset of obs_line_names that specifies the lines to include in
            the likelihood calculation.  By default, all the obs_line_names are
            used.  Lines that appear in obs_line_names but aren't used in the
            likelihood are included in the best_model_table (see below), and
            may be used in line ratio priors (see below).
        deredden : bool
            De-redden observed fluxes to match the Balmer decrement at each
            interpolated grid point?  Only supported if norm_line == "Hbeta",
            "Halpha" is also supplied, and there are no upper bounds in the
            measurements.  Default: False
        obs_wavelengths : list of floats
            A list of wavelengths (Angstroems) corresponding to obs_line_names,
            which must be supplied if deredden == True.  Default: None
        prior : list of ("line1","line2") tuples, or "Uniform", or a callable,
            or a numpy array.
            The prior to use in Bayes' Theorem when calculating the posterior.
            Either the string "Uniform", a user-defined callback function, a
            numpy array over the whole parameter space (with shape matching
            interpd_grid_shape), or a list of length at least one.  Entries in
            the list are tuples such as ("SII6716","SII6731") to specify a line
            ratio to use as a prior.  The listed line-ratio priors will all be
            multiplied together (weighted equally) and then normalised before
            being used in Bayes' Theorem.  See the "docs/Example-advanced.py"
            file to see an example user-defined callback function, showing the
            arguments it must accept.
            Default: "Uniform"

        Optional parameters - outputs
        -----------------------------
        Provide a value for a keyword to produce the corresponding output.
        estimate_table : str
            A filename for a csv file containing Bayesian parameter estimates
            for the grid parameters
        posterior_plot : str
            A filename for a 'corner' plot of 1D and 2D marginalised posterior
            PDFs. The image file type is specified by the file extension.
        prior_plot : str
            As for posterior_plot but for the prior
        likelihood_plot : str
            As for posterior_plot but for the likelihood
        best_model_table : str
            A filename for a csv file which will compare observed and model
            fluxes at the point defined by the Bayesian parameter estimates.
        line_plot_dir : str
            A directory where 'corner' plots showing the nD PDFs for each line
            will be saved.  These PDFs are the contribution to the likelihood
            from each line, and the plots show the constraints each line
            provides.  Saving these plots is slow; a ".pdf" file type is used.
        param_display_names : dict
            Display names for grid parameters, for plotting purposes.  The
            dictionary keys are parameter names from grid_params, and the
            corresponding values are the "display" names.  The display names
            can include markup (r"$\\alpha$") to include e.g. Greek letters.
            Raw text names will be used where a display name is not provided.
        plot_configs : list of dicts
            A list of four dictionaries which update plotting options for the
            0) Prior, 1) Likelihood, 2) Posterior, and 3) Individual line plots.
            To use the same config dict object for all four plot types, write
            "plot_configs=[my_dict]*4".  Valid items in each dictionary are:
                table_on_plot : bool
                    Include a text "best model" flux comparison table on the
                    'corner' plot?  (Doesn't apply to individual line plots).
                    Default: True
                show_legend : bool
                    Show the legend? (Doesn't apply to 1D grids). Default: True
                legend_fontsize : float
                    Fontsize for label text in legend.  Default: 4.5 pts
                cmap : str cmap name or matplotlib.colors.Colormap instance
                    The colormap for the images of the 2D marginalised PDFs.
                    Default: From black to white through green
                callback : callable
                    A user-defined function called instead of saving the plot,
                    which may be used to save a customised figure (e.g. with
                    annotations).  See the "docs/Example-advanced.py" file for
                    an example function, showing the arguments it must accept.
        verbosity : str
            Determine how much information is printed to the terminal by
            setting the level of the NebulaBayes logger.  Allowed levels (in
            order of more to less output) are "DEBUG", "INFO" and "WARNING".
            The logger object may be accessed as NebulaBayes.NB_logger.
            Default: "DEBUG"


        Returns
        -------
        NB_Result : NB3_Bayes.NB_Result instance
        This object holds the working and results of the Bayesian parameter
        estimation.  It has the following attributes, listed here roughly in
        order of decreasing importance:
            Posterior : NB3_Bayes.NB_nd_pdf instance
                Holds data for the posterior PDF, and has these attributes:
                DF_estimates : pandas DataFrame table holding the parameter
                    estimates, limits of the 68\% and 95\% credible intervals
                    (CIs), and results of checks for the PDF being up against
                    the edge of the parameter space or having a pathological
                    shape.  The CIs are calculated using the 1D CDF
                    independently of the parameter estimate.  The "low" and
                    "high" CI limits may be -inf or +inf respectively
                    if there is significant probability density near the edges
                    of the parameter space.  Because the parameter estimate is
                    at the peak of the PDF, it may not lie inside the CIs, and
                    "Est_in_CI68?" and "Est_in_CI95?" are checks for this.
                    There are also separate checks for whether the parameter
                    esimate is at the "lower" or "upper" bounds of the
                    parameter space, and for the number of local maxima in the
                    1D PDF.  This table may be accessed as
                    'NB_Result.Posterior.DF_estimates'.
                best_model : dict describing the model at the point in the PDF
                    defined by the parameter estimates, with the following keys
                    and values:
                    "table" : pandas DataFrame table comparing model and
                              observed fluxes for the "best model".  There is a
                              row per emission line.  Accessed as
                              'NB_Result.Posterior.best_model["table"]'
                    "chi2" :  The reduced chi^2 of the fit
                    "extinction_Av_mag" : The visual extinction in magnitudes
                              (if "deredden" was True)
                nd_pdf : The numpy ndarray which samples the posterior PDF over
                    the full interpolated parameter space
                Grid_spec : NB1_Process_grids.Grid_description instance which
                    has attributes "param_names", "param_values_arrs", "shape",
                    etc., describing the geometry of the interpolated grid.
                marginalised_1D : dict that maps parameter names to numpy
                                  arrays that sample the 1D marginalised PDFs
                marginalised_2D : dict mapping tuples of two parameter names to
                                  numpy arrays that sample 2D marginalised PDFs
                name : str giving the PDF name - "Posterior"
            Likelihood : NB3_Bayes.NB_nd_pdf instance
                As for the Posterior attribute, but for the likelihood PDF.
                The parameter estimates and best model are therefore for the
                "maximum likelihood estimates", rather than the full Bayesian
                parameter estimates.
            Prior : NB3_Bayes.NB_nd_pdf instance
                As for the Posterior and Likelihood attributes, but for the
                prior PDF.  The parameter estimates are for the "best" model
                according to the prior information, without updating for the
                observational data.
            deredden : bool
                Value of the "deredden" keyword.  Were observed fluxes
                dereddened all over the parameter space?
            DF_obs : pandas DataFrame
                Table of the observed emission line fluxes, errors, and
                wavelengths (if provided), with a row for each line.  Fluxes
                and errors are normalised to the norm_line flux.
